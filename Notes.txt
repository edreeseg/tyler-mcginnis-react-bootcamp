React is a library for building user interfaces.

What makes React so special?
	Composition
	Unidirecitonal Dataflow
	Explicit Mutations
	Just JavaScript
	
Composition:

	Building entire application from independent components (e.g. <Slider /> <Router /> <Carousel />)
	Helps to break large, complex apps into smaller chunks that can be worked on independently.
	Big two questions when designing component: What state does it need, and what will the UI look like?
	Makes components highly re-usable - can use the same component across multiple pages.
	
Unidirectional Dataflow:

	jQuery:
						State
	Event Handler -> Update DOM
	Event Hanlder -> Update DOM
	Event Handler -> Update DOM
	Event Handler -> Update DOM
	Event Handler -> Update DOM

		The above is the IDEAL situation.  Often times, these arrows criss-cross over one another, and DOM manipulation gets incredibly complex and 
		hard to predict.

		
	React:
	
	Event Handler ---->
	Event Handler ---->
	Event Handler ----> State ----> UI
	Event Handler ---->
	Event Handler ---->
	
		All event handlers flow into state which lives inside individual components, not DOM, and React is responsible for updating UI.
		UI is basically a function of state.  We only need to worry about the state, not UI.
		
	Explicit Mutations:
	
		e.g. this.setState({
			handle: 'tylermcginnis',
			authed: true
		});
		
		We explicitly change the state, and from there React alters the UI appropriately.  We never have to worry about changing the UI directly.
		
	Just JavaScript:
	
		Example code snippet:
		
		import React from 'react';
		
		function FriendsList(){
			const friends = ['Jordyn', 'Mikenzi', 'Jake'];
			
			return (
				<ul>
					{friends.map((name) => (
						<li>
							{name}
						</li>
					))}
				</ul>
			);
		}
		
		export default FriendsList;
		
	Shared Mutable State - Means we are sharing the same state throughout our entire application.  So, for example, if we have three views and they 
	all depend on the same state, changing the state in one view will change it in all.  It isn't necessarily a bad thing, but could potentially lead 
	to unexpected changes in one view when state is changed in another.
		
Difference between props and state:

	State is local to a component - a component can manage its own state.  Props are when you pass data into a component.
	

React vs. React-DOM

	You can render React in more than one environment (e.g. React Native).
	React-DOM is basically saying that we want to render React components to the DOM, as opposed to any other platform.
